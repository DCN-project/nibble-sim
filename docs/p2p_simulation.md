# On simulation for P2P network

## Why make a simulator?
- In order to propose, design, implement, and evaluate new P2P technologies, there is a key problem: how can experiments be performed and monitored in a “real” environment? Due to the complexity and scale of real P2P networks, a popular option is to use computer simulations.
- A P2P network can be simulated on one or more computers, allowing for the behavior of peers to be monitored precisely, giving the possibility
for iterative design, and perhaps most importantly, detailed evaluation.
